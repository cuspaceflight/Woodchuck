Folder for PCB stuff

Modules- 
	Power - battery + passives
		-- use a similar design/schematic to Joey? LDO vs switching regulator

	GPS - uBlox CAM-M8Q (2.7 to 3.6 V, 29mA max current and 7mA running current at 3V)
		-- talk to this over SPI (also supports UART and I2C)
		--https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/cam-m8-series
		--comes with chip antenna
		--Supports UBX, NMEA or RTCM(for sending correctional data to GPS only) protocols
		

	Radio - Radiometrix MTX2 transmitter + antenna
		-- talk using general GPIO pin
		-- enable pin connected to a serial port so we can configure the frequency.

	MCU - http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/DM00090510.pdf 
		stm32f072cbt6	
		-- need a new module on KiCad
		-- USART for science module - 4 pins JSTPA family of connectors http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1759149.pdf
		-- think about concurrency/using the radio module  - no problem
		-- use USB on here, can utilize ChibiOS Shell (serial port) 
		-- SWD for programming
		-- switch on BOOT0 pin to enable programming over USB (boots into on-chip bootloader)
		-- libopencm3 for HAL. Lightweight, can utilize instead of ChibiOS HAL. Wrapper for stuff
